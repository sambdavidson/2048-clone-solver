2048-clone-solver
=================

A clone of the iPhone game 2048. Tries to give the best possible move to make.

Use arrow keys to move the blocks. 
Press "p" to make an auto-move based on point total prediction.
Press "c" to make an auto-move based on board complexity prediction.

Still very much a work in progress.
